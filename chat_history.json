We'll also need to consider how to handle location data and user authentication.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-08-21T03:30:27.376625"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you expand the app to allow users to rate the vibe of any location and share these ratings with people in their surrounding area.
